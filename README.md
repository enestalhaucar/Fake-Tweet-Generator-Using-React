# Fake-Tweet-Generator-Using-React

### I did my work on the stackblitz.com site. The npm packages I use are:

On the right side of the screen are the clone of a tweet and on the left are the creation options. As you enter the input values on the left, there are instant changes on the tweet on the right.

The tweet is exactly the same, and after submitting it at the end, it allows you to take a screenshot and download the file to your computer.

#### The values I get as input;

* Name
* Surname
* Tweet
*  Avatar ( Profile Photo )
* Time
* Date
* View
* Retweet
* Quotes
* Likes
* Verified or Not
